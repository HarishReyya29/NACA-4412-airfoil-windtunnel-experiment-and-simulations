# NACA-4412-airfoil-windtunnel-experiment-and-simulations
This project investigates the aerodynamic performance of the NACA 4412 airfoil through both wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. It provides a hands-on comparison between experimental data and CFD results for validating airfoil lift, drag, and flow behavior over a range of angles of attack.
